                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our comprehensive maid service includes all standard cleaning tasks: dusting all surfaces, vacuuming carpets and rugs, mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms thoroughly, kitchen cleaning including appliances, making beds, emptying trash, and organizing common areas. We also include those special touches that make a difference - arranging pillows, organizing magazines, and maintaining the welcoming atmosphere of your home. We can customize our service to include additional tasks or focus on your priorities.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I schedule maid service?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The ideal frequency depends on your household size, lifestyle, and personal preferences. Most of our Kansas City clients choose weekly or bi-weekly maid service for consistent maintenance. Weekly service is perfect for busy families or those who entertain frequently, while bi-weekly service works well for smaller households or those who prefer professional deep cleaning less frequently. We can help you determine the best schedule during your consultation.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>It's entirely up to you! Many clients prefer to be out during their maid service and return to a beautifully clean home. Others like to be present, especially initially, to provide guidance and preferences. Our bonded and insured team can work with your existing security system, garage codes, or key arrangements. We'll discuss the best approach for your comfort and convenience during your initial consultation.</p>

                        <p>Personalization is what sets our maid service apart. During your initial consultation, we'll discuss any special requests, preferences, or areas that need extra attention. Whether you have specific ways you like things organized, particular products you prefer, or areas that require special care, we'll incorporate these into your customized maid service plan. We keep detailed notes about each client's preferences to ensure consistency with every visit.</p>
