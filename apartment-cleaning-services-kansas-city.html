                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We're experienced working with all types of apartment buildings in Kansas City, from high-security buildings to walk-up complexes. You can provide us with access codes, key fobs, or building procedures, and we'll coordinate with building management if needed. We can also work with doormen or concierge services. Many of our clients prefer to be home during service, but we're fully bonded and insured if you prefer to provide access while you're out.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! Apartment cleaning requires specialized techniques for smaller spaces, multi-functional rooms, and close neighbor considerations. We focus on maximizing storage efficiency, using products that won't create strong odors in close quarters, and cleaning techniques that make small spaces feel larger and more organized. We also understand apartment-specific challenges like limited natural light, bathroom ventilation, and kitchen space constraints.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! Our pricing is based on apartment size and specific needs. Studio and one-bedroom apartments have different pricing than larger units. We consider square footage, number of rooms, and complexity of cleaning needs. During your initial consultation, we'll assess your specific apartment and provide transparent, apartment-appropriate pricing that fits rental budgets.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! We understand that apartment renters often have specific lease requirements about cleaning and maintenance. Whether your landlord requires certain products, has restrictions on service times, or needs advance notice of service providers, we'll work within those parameters. We can also provide documentation of our cleaning services if needed for lease compliance or deposit protection.</p>

                        <p>Apartment life can be unpredictable - elevator outages, building maintenance, utility issues, or unexpected building access problems happen. We completely understand and offer flexible rescheduling without penalties for apartment-related issues beyond your control. Just give us as much notice as possible, and we'll work with you to find a new time that works with both your schedule and building requirements.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! We come fully equipped with all cleaning supplies and compact, apartment-appropriate equipment. We understand that apartment residents often have limited storage for cleaning supplies, so we bring everything needed. Our equipment is designed to work efficiently in smaller spaces and won't disturb neighbors. We also use eco-friendly products that are considerate of shared ventilation systems in apartment buildings.</p>
