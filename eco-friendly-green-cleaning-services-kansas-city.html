                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! Modern eco-friendly cleaning products are scientifically formulated to match or exceed the cleaning power of traditional chemicals. Many of our clients report that their homes stay cleaner longer with our green products because we eliminate the chemical residues that can actually attract dirt and grime. The key difference is that our products achieve superior results without putting your family's health at risk or polluting your indoor air quality.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We use only products that meet the strictest environmental and health standards: plant-based ingredients, no VOCs (volatile organic compounds), biodegradable formulas, no carcinogens or hormone disruptors, and certified by independent organizations like EPA Safer Choice. We can provide ingredient lists for any product we use, and everything is safe enough that your children and pets can be present during and immediately after cleaning.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Many families see significant improvement in allergy symptoms after switching to our eco-friendly cleaning. Traditional cleaners often contain fragrances, ammonia, chlorine, and other chemicals that can trigger respiratory issues and skin sensitivities. Our non-toxic approach eliminates these triggers while using specialized techniques to reduce allergens like dust mites, pet dander, and pollen naturally. The result is cleaner air and fewer allergy symptoms for your family.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our green cleaning is completely safe for pregnant women and developing babies. Traditional cleaning chemicals can pose risks during pregnancy, including respiratory irritation and exposure to hormone-disrupting compounds. Our plant-based, non-toxic products eliminate these concerns entirely. Many expecting mothers choose our service specifically to create the healthiest possible environment for their growing families without sacrificing cleanliness.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our green cleaning is competitively priced with traditional cleaning services, and many clients find it provides better long-term value. Eco-friendly products often work more efficiently, requiring less product to achieve superior results. Plus, the health benefits - fewer sick days, reduced allergy symptoms, better indoor air quality - often offset any price difference. We believe protecting your family's health shouldn't cost extra, so we keep our green cleaning affordable for Kansas City families.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! We use EPA-approved, plant-based disinfectants that eliminate 99.9% of germs and bacteria without toxic chemicals. Methods include hospital-grade natural disinfectants, steam cleaning for chemical-free sanitization, UV sanitization techniques, and natural antimicrobial products derived from plants. These methods are often more effective than chemical disinfectants because they don't create resistant bacteria or leave behind harmful residues.</p>
