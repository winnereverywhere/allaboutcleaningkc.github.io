            <p class="section-intro">Deep cleaning is a significant investment in your home. Here are answers to the questions Kansas City homeowners ask us most about our comprehensive deep cleaning services.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Deep cleaning time varies significantly based on your home's size, condition, and specific services needed. A typical 3-bedroom home takes 4-8 hours, while larger homes or those needing extensive work can take a full day or more. During our initial assessment, we'll provide a realistic timeframe. We never rush - deep cleaning is about thoroughness, not speed, and we take the time needed to deliver exceptional results.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our deep cleaning goes far beyond regular maintenance cleaning. We clean inside appliances, wash baseboards and light fixtures, scrub grout and tile, clean inside cabinets and drawers, wash walls and switches, detail bathroom fixtures, clean air vents, and address areas typically missed in regular cleaning. We also move furniture to clean underneath and behind, and tackle any buildup or grime that has accumulated over time.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I get deep cleaning service?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most homeowners benefit from deep cleaning 2-4 times per year, depending on their lifestyle, family size, and regular cleaning maintenance. Many clients schedule deep cleaning seasonally, before major holidays, or after significant events like illness or construction. If you maintain regular cleaning service, deep cleaning once or twice yearly is usually sufficient to keep your home in pristine condition.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! While whole-home deep cleaning provides the best value and results, we can focus on specific areas that need attention. Popular targeted deep cleaning services include kitchen appliance detailing, bathroom deep cleaning, basement or attic cleaning, or post-renovation cleanup for specific rooms. We'll customize our service to address your specific concerns and budget.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Minimal preparation is needed, but removing personal items and decluttering surfaces helps us clean more efficiently and thoroughly. We can work around your belongings, but clearing counters, picking up toys and personal items, and securing valuables allows us to focus entirely on cleaning. We'll discuss any specific preparation during scheduling based on the services you've requested.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Deep cleaning is an investment in your home's health, appearance, and your family's wellbeing. It eliminates buildup that can affect air quality, extends the life of appliances and fixtures, and creates a completely fresh environment. Many clients say their home feels brand new after deep cleaning. When you consider the cost of replacing items damaged by neglect or the health benefits of a truly clean environment, deep cleaning offers excellent value.</p>
