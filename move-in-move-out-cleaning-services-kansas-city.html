            <p class="section-intro">Moving brings lots of questions. Here are the answers to what Kansas City renters and homeowners ask us most about our move cleaning services.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While we recommend booking as soon as you know your move date to guarantee availability, we understand that moving plans can change quickly. We offer flexible scheduling and can often accommodate same-day requests. The busiest times are month-end and weekends, so booking in advance during these periods is especially helpful. However, don't worry if you're in a last-minute situation - call us anyway, as we often have availability even for emergency cleaning needs.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between move-in and move-out cleaning?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Move-out cleaning focuses on getting your deposit back by meeting landlord expectations and rental agreement requirements. This includes deep cleaning appliances, scrubbing bathrooms, detailed kitchen cleaning, and removing all traces of occupancy. Move-in cleaning focuses on sanitization and making the space feel fresh and yours, including disinfecting all surfaces, cleaning inside cabinets and closets, and ensuring everything feels brand new for your arrival.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">Do you clean while furniture is still in the home?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We prefer to clean after the space is empty for the most thorough results, but we can work around furniture if needed. For move-out cleaning, we typically clean after you've moved your belongings out. For move-in cleaning, we can clean before your furniture arrives or work around existing items. We'll discuss the timing during scheduling to determine what works best for your specific situation and moving timeline.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! We've worked with countless landlords and property management companies throughout Kansas City, and we know exactly what they expect. Our move-out cleaning checklist is designed to meet and exceed standard rental agreement cleaning requirements. We focus on the areas landlords inspect most: appliances, bathrooms, floors, walls, and windows. If your landlord has specific requirements, share them with us and we'll ensure they're met.</p>

                        <p>We understand that moving dates can be unpredictable! Just give us as much notice as possible, and we'll work with you to reschedule. We don't charge change fees for reasonable notice, and we'll do our best to accommodate your new timeline. If your move gets pushed up and you need earlier service, we'll check our availability and often can adjust to help you out.</p>

                        <p>Yes! We offer a satisfaction guarantee on all our move cleaning services. If your landlord finds any cleaning issues that result in deposit deductions, contact us within 72 hours and we'll return to address the concerns at no charge. For move-in cleaning, if you're not completely satisfied with the cleanliness when you arrive, we'll make it right immediately. Your peace of mind during your move is our priority.</p>
